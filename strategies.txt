Building construction:

#1: if cell has no forcefield value, build a fortress. This would mean that every approximately every 1 in 5
cells will contain a fortress. Split the other two cell spaces between gold and energy.

Downsides: attacking with excess energy will lead to forcefields always being up. This would mean fortresses would
never get constructed in the first place. 
- Could be resolved by constructing a fortress if the forcefield does not cross a needed threshold value.

Considerations:
- Between gold and energy, is one of the two resources more valuable?


#2: Conquerer's approach:
- Upgrade cells from the farther ones first, always advancing the line up until the cells that actually meet the opponent colonies

#3: Does the colony need a cap on scaling at all?

Algorithm feature: decision tree
- Determine by turn count, number of owned cells, number of buildings, distribution of resources

#4 Cap cell growth until tech 3 is hit

#5 centralize damage on the home base when found
